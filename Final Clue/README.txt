In this folder is a 40,000-line CSV file. Each line contains an X and Y coordinate and a value of either 0 or 1. Use this CSV file to generate a QR code that will lead you to your FINAL STEP.

Hints:

- This CSV file was generated using python
- I used the following packages: numpy, skimage.io, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas
- I highly recommend that you use python (Specifically JupyterLab)
- 200x200 = 40,000
- A QR code has more white pixels than black ones. If a pixel is not a 1, it must be a zero.
- Black and White have RGB values of (0,0,0) and (255,255,255) respectively.
- This is your last challenge so donâ€™t give up.
