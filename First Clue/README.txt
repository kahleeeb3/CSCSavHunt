So, you found the first clue…

Inside this folder you will find a file named “secret_code.txt”. However, you will not be able to read what it says. Using a programming language of your choice, figure out how to solve the “Caesar Cipher” used to encode this secret message. In doing so, you will find your next clue. The code you write must be provided to the grader to claim your prize.

Hints:

- I used python to create this, however, you may use whatever language you choose
- I used JupyterLab for all of my solutions, however, you do not need to
- I did not use any additional packages to make this
- Which Fibonacci number is also prime?
